# DoorDash 

## Overview 

        I started working at DoorDash right after graduating from UC Berkeley in
        summer of 2022. My initial role at the company was on an internal tools
        team that built applications for our non-engineering partners to use.
        Eventually, I landed on the test platform team, where my work primarily
        involved building infrastructure for code coverage ingestion & flaky
        test detection/quarantining.

My current work is on building mechanisms to test our storefront products. 

## Code Coverage 

A majority of my work at DoorDash revolves around enabling engineers 
to track & monitor their unit test & system test coverage. 


## Internal Tools 

My first set of work at DoorDash was migrating some of our internal tools 
out from a Django monolith into React. 

export default function MDXPage({ children }) {
        return <MdxLayout>{children}</MdxLayout>
}
